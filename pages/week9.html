      <h1>What is BIOS?</h1>

        <p>
          BIOS is actually UEFI in modern computers and it's firmware that makes your pc run. Its core features are:
          <ul>
            <li>Power-On Self-Test(POST): Check every hardware component to make sure everything works well</li>
            <li>Bootstrap Loader: Loads the bootloader of your operating system and runs it</li>
            <li>CMOS Setup Utility: It's an interface program(GUI) that is the settings app for your hardware</li>
            <li>Interface with Hardware: It's the link between your operating system and the hardware</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          BIOS is firmware == code, so that means it can be updated and that's where flashing the BIOS comes in. People generally do it to update the old BIOS to support new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BIOS is a chip on your motherboard which is the central part of your pc, connecting everything together and it gives power to your CPU and RAM.<br>
          The motherboard also has ports on which you can connect all of your devices such as mouse, keyboard, screen, speakers, etc.
