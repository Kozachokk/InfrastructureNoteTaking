        <p>
          A file is a collection of data stored in a drive, a storage device.
          They are made up of 1s and 0s
        </p>
        <p>
          The Os differentiates file types by their file extension, magic
          numbers and file metadata
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>File Extensions</dt>
          <dd>
            It's the characters that are on the end of the file: .jpeg, .mov,
            .html
          </dd>
          <dt>Magic Numbers</dt>
          <dd>
            Magic numbers are the first few bytes of a file that contain the
            file signature
          </dd>
          <dt>File Metadata</dt>
          <dd>
            Files contain also data about themselves and that's called metadata
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>How does the computer store sound and light in 1s and 0s?</p>
        <p>
          Audio files are encoded through converting sound into a continuous
          electrical signal which is then stored as a stream of binary data.<br />
          The digital data is often compressed using a codec like .WAV or .MP3
        </p>
        <p>
          Image files, there are two types: Vector which use geometry to draw
          pictures and raster which use individual pixels with each a three
          8-bits values, RGB, red, green, blue
        </p>
        <p>
          File compression is an important aspect of files, there are two types:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Lossless</dt>
          <dd>
            Keeps all original data and reduces it using Redundancy reduction,
            which basically replaces consecutive data with a single value and a
            count and<br />Dictionnary based, which replaces repeated patters
            with a code which is stored in a dictionnary.
          </dd>
          <dt>Lossy</dt>
          <dd>
            Permanently removes data that the human brain cannot comprehend,<br />for
            example in an audio file it will remove sounds that the human brain
            cannot hear, so what's the point of keeping it?
