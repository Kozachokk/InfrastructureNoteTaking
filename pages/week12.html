          Version control software(VCS) is software that is used to
          automatically control and track changes to project(repositories), in
          order to efficiently store multiple versions of them<br />
          Git is an open-source distributed version control system(DVCS) meaning
          that it's a VCS, but every person that downloads a copy of the
          repository, downloads the whole history on their machine<br />
          Commonly used commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>git init: creates a local git repository</li>
          <li>git add: adds files to the staging area</li>
          <li>
            git commit -m "message": saves the changes to the local repository
          </li>
          <li>
            git status: show the state of the working directory and staging area
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Branches are also an important concept in version control since they
          are essentially a copy of the project on which you can work without
          changing anything in the main branch that has the working code,<br />
          so you can test and play with new things without breaking anything<br />
          Commonly used commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>git branch &lt;name&gt;: creates a new branch</li>
          <li>git switch &lt;branch_name&gt;: Switches to another branch</li>
          <li>
            git merge &lt;branch_name&gt;: Merges current branch with another
            one
          </li>
          <li>
            git checkout &lt;name&gt;: Swithces between differet version of the
            project
          </li>
          <li>git branch: List all branches</li>
          <li>git branch -v: List all branches in verbose mode</li>
          <li></li>
          <li>git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt;: Deletes the branch</li>
          <li>
            git branch -m &lt;Old branch name&gt; &lt;New branch name&gt;:
            Renames the branch
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are also remote repositories which are hosted online so anyone
          can access them, they act as a central hub, popular hosts include:
          Github, Gitlab, Bitbucker<br />
          Commonly used commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>git clone &lt;url&gt;: Creates a copy in a local repository</li>
          <li>
            git push origin &lt;branch_name&gt;: Uploads the local changes to
            the origin(remote repository)
          </li>
          <li>
            git pull origin &lt;branch_name&gt;: Downloads the branch from the
            remote repository to the locac one
          </li>
          <li>
            git fetch origin: Downloads objects and refs from another repository
          </li>
