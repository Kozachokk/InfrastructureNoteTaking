      <h1>What is memory?</h1>

      <article>
        <p>
          There are a lot of types of memory and types for each of those types. The hierarchy of memory, with decreasing speed and cost and increasing storage:
          <ul>
            <li>Registers: Fastest memory type that lives inside the CPU</li>
            <li>L1/L2 Cache: Resides near the CPU</li>
            <li>L3 Cache: Shared between the CPUs</li>
            <li>RAM: In your computer used to store current programs running</li>
            <li>SSD/HDD: Permanent Storage, the slowest one, but the biggest one</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your operating system resides inside the RAM(Random-acces memory) which is a faster type of memory than SSD/HDD.<br>
          At first there was SIMM(Single in-line memory), which used only one side of the stick for pins.<br> And then came DIMM(dual in-line memory), which is the smarted brother that uses both of its sides.<br><br>
          Also at first there was SDRAM(Synchronous Dynamic RAM), which synchronyzed with the system's clock speed.<br> And then came DDR(Double Data Rate), which synchronyzed on both the fall and elevation of the system's clock speed.
        </p>
        <p>Another important factor when selecting your RAM, is the CAS latency, which is the time that the RAM need in order to fetch its data<br>
        Also some motheboard support dual channel, meaning they access both of your RAM sticks and it basically doubles your speed</p>
        <p>
          There are two major permanent storages used: SSD and HDD<br>
          SSD uses flash memory, which is a technology that is used to store data without requiring electricity<br>
          HDD uses magnetic memory, which is a technology that stores data using polarities
        </p>
        <p>
          Other honorable mention is Optical Data Storage, which stores data in reflective qualities of a disk
