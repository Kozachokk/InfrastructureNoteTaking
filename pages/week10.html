      <h1>Operating System</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          The Operating System(OS) is software that is the middle man between
          hardware and software, and also between the computer and the user.
          <br />There are two major types: Graphical user interface(GUI) and
          command-base interface(CLI) <br />Operating Systems are responsable to
          manage memory, files and processes
        </p>

          <dt>Memory Management</dt>
          <dd>
            The OS maps the memory of connected devices so that the CPU can use
            them using a technique called Memory Mappe I/O<br />
            VRAM is Virtual Memory is case when the system RAM is full, it's
            going to unload some unused processes into the disk to free up
            space, it's also called sometimes swap
          </dd>
          <dt>File Management</dt>
          <dd>
            The OS can use file system to organize data, some frequetly used
            include FAT, TFS, ext, HFS, APFS<br />
            There are many ways to store data on storage devices, including
            Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation and Indexed Allocation<br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Contiguous Allocation starts on one block and fills up next
                blocks, taking one by one until its length. The data is stored
                all in one place
              </li>
              <li>
                Linked Allocation starts with one random block, and this block
                contains a link to the next, which is also random. The data is
                scattered
              </li>
              <li>
                Indexed Allocation, a set of continuous block contains a list of
                indices to all the other block. The data is scattered
              </li>
            </ul>
            The OS also manages file permission, with three groups: owner,
            group, public. It manages execution, write and read permissions
          </dd>
          <dt>Process Management</dt>
          <dd>
            Processes are instances of running programs, aka software<br />
            During their creation, the OS allocates system ressources to them
            and a process control block(PCB)<br />
            The PCB is a data structure linked to every process,created by the
            OS, that contains the process ID, its priority, the CPU registers
            and memory pointers<br />
            The OS use a scheduler to share equally the CPU to all the processes
            so all of them can run<br />
            During that sharing of the CPU, the processes on pause, save their
            state to their PCB so that they can continue running afterwards
