      <h1>What is a CPU?</h1>

        <p>Central Processing Unit(CPU):<br>
          &nbsp&nbspCPUs are considered the brain of the computer since they are performing all the calculations. A CPU has three main components:
          <ul>
            <li>Control Unit(CU):
              <br>&nbsp&nbsp Controls the flow of the information</li>
            <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU):<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp The component that performs the calculations</li>
            <li>Registers:<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp Stores data and instructions for and from the ALU</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br>
        <p>
          CPUs these days are multi-cored, meaning in one piece there are multiple CPU that each have Level 1 and Level 2 Cache, and a Level 3 Cache that is shared with all the CPUs.<br>
          In order to communicate with the rest of the computer the CPU connects with the motherboard with pins.
          Also these days, there are two types of CPUs sockets,<br> we have Land Grid Array, that mean the the CPU uses Lands and the motherboard has the pins, with a Pin Grid Array CPU it's vice-versa.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          A typical CPU cycle is Fetch ==> Decode ==> Execute ==> Store, and modern CPUs run billions of those cycle per second<br> which is coincidentally also the measurement of Hz, so most modern CPUs are in the GHz.
          <ul>
            <li>Fetch: Fetches the instruction</li>
            <li>Decode: Converts the instruction to machine code</li>
            <li>Execute: Runs the translated machine code</li>
            <li>Store: Stores the result in memory</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Another important thing about the cycle is that CPUs can pipeline, meaning they can run those four operations at the same time<br> instead to running them one by one and starting over. With pipelining it's possible to run 4 commands with the CPU
